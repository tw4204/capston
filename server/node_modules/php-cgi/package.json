This module was developed for deskshell \n(http://deskshell.org) to allow seamless handling of php scripts.\n\nGiven that you get a request in nodejs and have a request object (called req) and a response object (called res) this is how you would use this module:\n\n    \n    reqdata = require(\"url\").parse(req.url,true);\n\t\tswitch(require(\"path\").extname(reqdata.pathname)) {\n\t\t    case \".php\":\n\t\t\t\t    var phpCGI = require(\"php-cgi\");\n\t\t\t\t    phpCGI.detectBinary();//on windows get a portable php to run.\n\t\t\t\t    phpCGI.env['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] = __dirname+path.sep+'htdocs'+path.sep;\n\t\t\t\t    phpCGI.serveResponse(req, res, phpCGI.paramsForRequest(req));\n\t\t\t\tbreak;\n\t\t}\n\nSo a request to /test.php would be responded to by the php-cgi module. The paramsForRequest function reads the request object and sets the correct cgi environmental variables for the request. This is provided as a separate function so it\nis possible to add in additional request variables as needed. The detectBinary function on windows looks for an additional\nnode module \"php-bin-win32\" that provides a portable php binary.\n \nThis code works for deskshell, contact me if you want to use it for some other purpose and need additional features / support.\n\n",
